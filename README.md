# Welcome to Squatch
Squatch is a flexbox framework for a small to meduim sized site. The goal is to be able to take care of the responsive layout of the site with easy to read and remember css classes, while not being too opinionated about styling components. 

### to start a new project with gulp

@import into your scss with something like:
